## Javascript compared to Java

| Javascript  | Java  |
| -----------| ---- |
| Object-oriented. No distinction between types of objects. Inheritance is through the prototype mechanism, and properties and methods can be added to any object dynamically. | Class-based. Objects are divided into classes and instances with all inheritance through the class hierarchy. Classes and instances cannot have properties or methods added dynamically. |
| Variable data types are not declared (dynamic typing, loosely typed). | Variable data types must be declared (static typing, strongly typed). |
