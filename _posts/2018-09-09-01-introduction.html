## Solution

.bigger[
- Invest time to make most of your IDE.
- Use a debugger on the client and on the server side.
- Use a build pipeline and take advantage of various automated tasks.
]

---
## In practice

.bigger[
- Microsoft Visual Studio Code
- Debug client-side code
- Node.js & npm (nvm)
- Debug server-side code
- Letâ€™s start without a build pipeline
]

---
## Development environment

For this course, you'll need to install the following tools.

- A decent browser with developer tools - Google Chrome.
- A code editor - we recommend Microsoft Visual Studio Code

---
## Install Node.js

Node.js is an open-source and cross-platform runtime environment used for development of server-side web applications

There is two different ways to install Node.js

1. Go to the [download page](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), get the installer for your system and launch it. Be sure to install the version labeled LTS

2. (Recommended) Install Node.js via [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) (nvm) which is a command line tool that let you install several node versions at the same time and switch between them as you wish.


---
## Install Node.js via nvm

To install or update nvm, you can use the install script using cURL. Copy and past the following command into your terminal:
```sh
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.33.11/install.sh | bash
```

When the installation has completed familiarize yourself with common commands:

- `nvm current` - Display currently activated version of Node.js
- `nvm list` - List installed versions
- `nvm install <version>` - Install a specific version number
- `nvm use <version>` - Switch to another version

> Note: nvm does not support Windows but you can use [nvm-windows]() as an alternative which has a similar interface.

---
name: install-live-server
## Install live-server

Along with the node command you also have access to a command called [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/what-is-npm). npm stands for Node Package Manager and gives you access to an enormous collection of modules created by the community one of them is [live-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/live-server).

Live server is a little development server written in Node with hot reload capability. It'll save you time by reloading your page after changes to your files.

Open your **terminal** and type the following command:

```sh
npm install -g live-server
```

---
name: test-live-server
## Test live-server

You can easily test your server by creating a directory with an index.html file.

```sh
$ mkdir html-playground
$ cd html-playground
$ echo '<h1>Hello world!</h1>' > index.html
```

Then run the following command from the directory you just created:
```sh
$ live-server
```

Your default browser should open an page at `http://127.0.0.1:8080/`. Try make some changes to the `index.html` file and hit save. You should instantly see those changes reflected in your browser.

> Your page looks ugly ? Don't worry we'll soon make it a bit better.

name: debug-client-side
## Debug client-side code

Now we'll see how a set of development tools called [Chrome DevTools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/) can increase our productivity.

Chrome DevTools can do a lot - code-coverage and memory analysis, benchmarking, mobile device simulation and the list goes on and on. 

For now we'll see the most commonly used features

- Editing any web page on the fly
- Debugging network activities
- Debugging Javascript

You'll discover other tools as you need them when working on your projects.

---
### Setup a project structure

Open the `html-playground` project you just created with Visual Studio Code
> Pro tip: Open a project with Visual Studio Code from your terminal by running `code .` from your project directory.

And setup a basic project structure by adding a script and a stylesheet.

```diff
 html-playground
 â”œâ”€â”€ index.html
+â”œâ”€â”€ css
+â”‚   â””â”€â”€styles.css
+â””â”€â”€js
+    â””â”€â”€app.js
```

---
### Write a simple web page
Write a simple page that loads your stylesheet and your script - then launch live-server and open your [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) with Google Chrome.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
*    <link href="/css/style.css" rel="stylesheet">
     <title>HTML playground</title>
  </head>
  <body>
     <h1>Welcome TWEB 2018</h1>
*    <script src="/js/app.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

.pull-left[
  ```css
  /* css/style.css */
  h1 {
    color: blue;
    text-align: center; 
  }
  ```
]

.pull-right[
  ```javascript
  /* js/app.js */
  var msg = 'hello console';
  console.log(msg);
  ```
]

---
### Chrome DevTools - Network
Once the page is open, launch Chrome DevTools with a `right-click` on the page > and choose `Inspect`.
In the `Network` tab you'll see all requested resources with a lot of useful information.

The figure below shows that browser first requested our HTML file - listed as `localhost`. Once the HTML was fully downloaded and parsed, the browser request two other resources *almost* at the same time - `style.css` then `app.js`.

---
### Chrome DevTools - Elements

`Elements` tab is where you can debug your HTML page and CSS. It allows you to see which CSS rules is being applied to any element.

You can also edit your HTML or CSS rules. This is really great for prototyping and debugging. 

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/01-devtools-elements.png" width="100%" height="auto">

---
### Chrome DevTools - Console

When something doesn't work as expected with your site, your first reaction should be checking the `Console` and see
if any error was reported.

In addition to viewing logging and error messages, you can also use the Console to evaluate arbitrary Javascript. 

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/01-devtools-console.png" width="100%" height="auto">

---
### Chrome DevTools - Debugger
The `Sources` tab is where you can debug your code using breakpoints.  A breakpoint lets you pause your code in the middle of its execution, and examine all values at that moment in time.

## Debug server-side code

Visual Studio Code has an integrated debugger that you can use to debug your server-side code. 

Let's create a boring Node.js server that respond `Hello world` to all requests:
- Create a folder for your project. I call it `node-playground`.
- Run `npm init` from your project directory. This will create a `package.json` file.
- Create an `server.js` file. This is where you'll write your code.

```diff
 node-playground
 â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
 â””â”€â”€ server.js
```

### Creating a simple server

No need for any external libraries to create an HTTP server with Node.
In this example, we use Node's http module which is loaded on the first line. 

- We use the `createServer` function to define a callback that should respond to any incoming request,
  also known as: `request handler`
- We define a port that the server should listen to for requests.

```javascript
// server.js
const http = require('http');
const port = 8080;

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' });
  res.end('Hello world!');
});

// Start the server
server.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Magic happens at http://localhost:${port}`);
});
```
---
### Test your server

To run a node program, use the `node` command and pass in a filename to execute. 
Start your server by running the following command in your terminal.

```sh
$ node server.js
```

Then point you browser to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to see some magic.

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/01-hello-server.png" width="100%" height="auto">

---
### Debugging your server

As with Chrome DevTools, Visual Studio Code lets you add breakpoints to our code and
inspect the execution.

- You can debug **server-side** code - Launching your server in debug mode or attaching the debugger to a running process.

- You can also debug **client-side** code - Using the [Debugger for Chrome](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=msjsdiag.debugger-for-chrome) extension.

> But for now, we'll just see how to debug our hello world server.

---
### Debugging your server

To set a breakpoint in `server.js`, put the editor cursor on a line and press `F9` or click in the editor left gutter next to the line numbers. A red circle will appear in the gutter.

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/01-vscode-breakpoint.png" height="100px">

To start debugging, select the `Debug View` in the Activity Bar then click on the Debug tool bar green arrow or press `F5`.

## ESLint
ESLint is a popular linting utility for Javascript that is frequently used to find **problematic patterns** or code that doesnâ€™t adhere to certain **style guidelines**
- It provides a level of **clarity** to your code
- It makes your code easier to **read** and **maintain**
- It can analyze your code and warn you of **potential errors**.

When configured and integrated in your code editor, ESLint will warn you as you type. See the following example in Visual Studio Code.

![Eslint at work in VSCode]({{site.baseurl}}/images/01-eslint-vscode.gif)

---
## Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide
Eslint was designed in pluggable way to allow developers to create their own linting rules.

[Airbnb maintains a very popular style guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript)
which is a set of ESLint rules that you can use and extend.

The documentation explains the reason for their choices for each rule. Here is [an example](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript#variables) with the rules called: `no-undef` and `prefer-const`.

> Always use `const` or `let` to declare variables. Not doing so will result in global variables. We want to avoid polluting the global namespace. Captain Planet warned us of that.

```javascript
// bad
superPower = new SuperPower();

// good
const superPower = new SuperPower();
```

---
## Install ESLint

There is to ways to install ESLint.
- locally **(recommended)** - including ESLint as our project development dependency. Run the following command from your project directory:
```sh
npm install --save-dev eslint
```
This will create the `node_modules` directory in your current directory (if one doesn't exist yet) and will download the package to that directory.


- globally - By running this command in your terminal:
```sh
npm install -g eslint
```
As we did earlier [when we installed live-server](#install-live-server), the `-g` or `--global` argument will cause npm to install the package globally rather than locally


---
## Configure ESLint
Once installed locally, you can run the `init` command which will help you setup a configuration file.

```sh
$ ./node_modules/.bin/eslint --init
```

Then answer the questions like bellow to configure ESLint with Airbnb's Javascript Style Guide:

```sh
? How would you like to configure ESLint? Use a popular style guide
? Which style guide do you want to follow? Airbnb
? Do you use React? No
? What format do you want your config file to be in? JavaScript
? Would you like to install them now with npm? Yes
```

---
## Configure ESLint
After running `eslint --init` you'll have a `.eslintrc.js` file in your project directory.
This file includes the line:

```javascript
"extends": "airbnb-base"
```

Which turns on all rules listed in [Airbnb Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript).
You can use this file to customize your rules according to your team code style. 

For example, if you fell tired of semicolons (which are required by default in
[`airbnb-base`](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/blob/master/packages/eslint-config-airbnb-base/rules/style.js#L448)) you can customize the [`semi`](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/semi#require-or-disallow-semicolons-instead-of-asi-semi) rule to warn whenever they are used:

```json
"extends": "airbnb-base"
"rules": {
    "semi": ["warn", "never"],
},
```

Or simply disable the rule with `"semi": "off"`. for more configuration options and details,
see the [configuration docs](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/configuring)


---
## Use ESLint

ESLint comes with a command line utility which you just used to run the `init` step.
The following command **runs ESLint on every `.js` files** in the project root directory
and prints out all errors and warnings:

```sh
$ ./node_modules/.bin/eslint **.js
```

----

This is equivalent to adding an npm script in your `package.json`

```json
// package.json
"scripts": {
  "lint": "eslint **.js"
}
```

then run `npm run lint`.

npm will spawn a shell and run `eslint **.js`.
The shell environment has your `./node_modules/.bin` folder added to the `PATH`
which means any of the dependencies you have that install binaries will be runnable directly.

---
## Use ESLint

In general you won't often use ESLint command line interface directly as it'll be redundant.

- The command line interface is generally integrated inside a **build pipeline** to prevent for example developers from deploying low quality code - many projects prevents `git commit` when the `lint` step fails.

- The command line interface can be used by code editors to **highlight errors** as you type or **automatically fix errors** for you. This is what we'll see next by integrating ESLint in Visual Studio Code. 

---
## ESLint in Visual Studio Code

Open Visual Studio Code and search for ESLint in the `Extensions` pan. Click on the `Install` button then restart VS Code.

<figure>
  <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/01-eslint-extension.png" width="100%" height="auto" alt="ESLint extension">
  <figcaption>ESLint extension</figcaption>
</figure>

When the extension is installed - VSCode will look for the `eslint` binary in your project dependencies and the `.eslintrc.js` configuration file to start analyzing your code. And that's it ðŸŽ‰!
