This is the main online venue for TWEB 2018, a course on modern web development taught at the [HEIG-VD](https://heig-vd.ch/) in Yverdon-les-Bains, Switzerland.

## Objectives
The first objective of the course is to become familiar with the rich and constantly evolving ecosystem of web technologies. We will look at many tools, frameworks and techniques. At the end of the course, you should be able to describe what “categories” of tools exist and how they complement each other. You should be able to explain what is in the arsenal of a modern web developer.

> We will write end-to-end applications and see that Javascript can be used on the client and on the server. We will store data in different types of databases. We will write interactive apps. We will create beautiful visualizations.

The second objective is to improve core Javascript skills. Throughout the course, we will review constructs and talk about the evolution of the language. We will compare “old-style” Javascript idioms with “ES6” idioms. One of the recurrent topics will be asynchronous programming. We will compare different ways to write asynchronous code. We will talk about callbacks and promises, but also about async/await and reactive extensions.

## Code, code, code

While we will present concepts during the lectures, we will put a strong focus on coding. During the semester, we will work on two different projects. During the last 3 weeks of the semester, you will present and demonstrate your entire portfolios.

Both projects have a specific theme, but you'll have enough freedom to show your creativity - building original, beautiful and engaging prototypes.
